            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>AS <hi>Conveyancing</hi> is one of the biggest Branches of the Great Body of the Law, and well digested Deeds or Written Instruments, the Fruits thereof; So a Faculty to discern such as are mature and ripe, to answer their proper ends and uses, is one of the greatest Requisits, and (if obtain'd) Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complishments belonging to the whole System of Clerkship.</p>
            <p>Instead therefore of a <hi>Preface</hi> to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Book, we have thought it more proper (on this Occasion) to make an <hi>Introduction,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing each manner of Deeds now used in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyancing, and thereby the passing of Estates from one to another.</p>
            <p>And because every Deed is not fit and proper for every Occasion to be used; but some being proper on some Occasions, and some useful on others, the Law having applied to every Deed their particular Operaion: It may not therefore be amiss, to give some Account in General of each particular Deed, and of their peculiar use, so as to be employed as Occasions require them, before we come to the Book it self.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:49986:4"/>
            <p>But first we will consider of a Deed in its entire Body, and next proceed to its Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of a Deed entire.</head>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Deed, what.</note>A <hi>Deed,</hi> is a Writing or Written Instrument, either on Paper or Parchment, (as may be thought most convenient) Sealed and Delivered by the Parties thereto, to prove and testify their Agreement to such matters and things as are therein contained.</p>
               <p>Some Deeds concern Realty, as a Feoffment of Lands, &amp;c. and some Personalty, as a Gift of Goods, and the like.</p>
               <p>Also some Deeds are Poll, and some In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Deed Poll.</note>
                  <hi>Poll Deeds</hi> are so called, because they are cut even and plain at the Top, and properly are single and but of one part, and is intended for the use of the Grantee, Feoffee or Lessee.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Indentures.</note>
                  <hi>Deeds Indented</hi> are such as are cut in and out at the Top, and properly made when there are intended to be Two or more Parts thereof, that they may at the Top be cut into one another, and are all to contain the same Words, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants or Agreements.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Deed Poll</hi> commonly begins in these Words; <hi>To all People to whom these Presents shall come, &amp;c.</hi> Or, <hi>Know all Men by these Presents, &amp;c.</hi> and may run on in the First Person, or in the Third. The other usually thus; <hi>This Indenture made, &amp;c.</hi> Yet if it be not actually Indented, though it begin in these words, it is no Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; also if it be Indented and begin not in these words, it is an <hi>Indenture,</hi> and that for the Reasons aforesaid: And commonly each Party hath a Part of the Indenture, after they have
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:49986:4"/> interchangably Sealed and Delivered to one another. It usually runs in the Third Person, but may be good in the First, where both par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties Seal and Deliver; therefore they are often called <hi>Bipartite, Tripartite, Quadripartite, &amp;c.</hi> having two, three or four parts and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.</p>
               <p>That part which the Grantor, Feoffor or Lessor seals, is called the <hi>Principal</hi> or <hi>Original,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Original.</note> and the rest are said to be <hi>Counterparts</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Counterpart.</note> or <hi>Copies;</hi> and yet all of them do make but one entire <hi>Deed</hi> in Law, though every part asunder is of as great force and effect, as all the parts together. For the Words of the Indenture are looked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as the Words of either party, and shall be applied to that party to whom they properly belong. See <hi>Co. upon Lit.</hi> 35, 143, 229.</p>
               <q>And Note, That there may be divers kinds<note place="margin">Divers kinds.</note> of <hi>Deeds;</hi> for every Agreement put in Writing, and Sealed and Delivered, becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a <hi>Deed.</hi>

               <p>They are said to be <hi>Conveying;</hi> because Estates then, or formerly made, are thereby Conveyed to others.</p>
               <p>Also some Deeds consist of <hi>Discharges,</hi>

                  <p>A <hi>Covenant to stand seized to Uses,</hi> may be in this sort: A man that hath a Wife and Children, Brothers and Kinsfolk, may by Deed covenant and agree, That for their or any of their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments, he will stand seized of Land to their use, either for Life in Tail, or Fee-simple.</p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:49986:6"/>
                  <p>And upon this Agreement there ariseth an Equity, That the Land shall go according to his Agreement: And the aforesaid Statute 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. Conveyeth the Estate of the Land as the Use is appointed.</p>
                  <p>Note also,<note place="margin">Consideration to raise an Use.</note> There must be a Consideration to raise an Use according to this Statute: For if the Party to whole Use he agreeth to stand seized of the Land, be not Wife, Children, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle or Cousin, or one that he intendeth to Marry, then will no Use arise, and so no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance.</p>
                  <p>For although the Law allow the Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Marriage and Blood to raise Uses; yet doth it not so of trifling Considerations, as Old Acquaintance, Schooling, Service, and the like. 1 <hi>Co.</hi> 176. 2 <hi>Co.</hi> 15, 76. 3 <hi>Cro.</hi> 394. <hi>Dyer</hi> 169, 312. 1 <hi>Cro.</hi> 529. <hi>Jon.</hi> 418. <hi>Plow.</hi> 307. <hi>Yelv.</hi> 51.</p>
                  <p>And therefore if one Bargain and Sell his Land to another by Deed Indented and Inrol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led without Consideration, it seems no use will rise by this to the Bargainee. But if it be in Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of a competent Sum of Money; as 100 <hi>l.</hi> paid or to be paid, or for Counsel given, or the like; in these Cases the Use will arise to the Bargainee well enough.</p>
                  <p>Also where a man maketh an Estate of his Land to others by Fine, Feoffment or Recovery, he may then appoint the use to whom he listeth, without respect of Kindred, Marriage-Mony or other thing: But he cannot do so when he maketh no Estate, but only agreeth to stand seized: Nor in Bargain and Sale, when he hath taken a Consideration as aforesaid.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>The Effect<note place="margin">The Effect.</note> of such Exchange is, That it doth give the Interest and alter the property of the thing Exchanged to either party, according to the Agreement.</p>

                     <note place="margin">What an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth.</note>Also in the Law, Exchange importeth a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Re-entry and a Warranty, Voucher and Recompence of the other Land that was given in Exchange, and an Exchanger may Re-enter upon an Assignee; That is, A Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to give a Re-entry upon all the Land given in Exchange, if he be put out of all or part of the Land taken in Exchange, and a Warranty to enable him to Vouch, and to recover over in value so much of his own Land again, given in Exchange, if he be sued for it.</p>
                  <p>So that upon every Exchange, either party (if he be put out of, or lose by Action the Land he taketh in Exchange) hath a double Remedy<note place="margin">Double Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy.</note> against the other; but yet this Remedy doth go only in the Privity, and shall not go
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:49986:7"/> to an Assignee. Therefore if one of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties is put out of all or part of the Land, or out of part of the Estate by Entry, and the other Party enters upon the others Land upon the Condition in Law, he may enter upon the whole Land and avoid the whole Exchange; but if he be impleaded for a part only, or for the whole, and a part only be recovered from him,<note place="margin">Recovery in Value.</note> in this case he shall recover so much in Value of the other Land only as he hath lost, and no more.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Example:</hi> As if an Exchange be of three Acres for three Acres, and after one of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties is put out of one of the Acres by the Entry of a Stranger; in this case he may enter upon the whole three Acres he had given in Exchange, and so avoid the whole Exchange, if he will. 4 <hi>Co.</hi> 121. <hi>Vide Bro.

                  <p>But Note,<note place="margin">Exception.</note> If all or part of the things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the Exchange is made do lye in several Counties, or if all or part be such as lye in Grant, and not in Livery, though it be in the same County, in this case it must be made by Deed Indented in Writing: But where the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change is of Lands, and of Lands lying in the same County, though it be of an Estate of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold or Inheritance, yet it may be made by Word of Mouth without Writing. And so it may be, when the things Exchanged do lye in divers Counties, when the Exchange is made only for a Term of Years. <hi>Co.

                  <p>And yet in case of the Grant of Land in possession in Exchange, no Livery of Seisin<note place="margin">Seisin.</note> is needful.</p>
                  <p>Neither is it needful that either Party to the Exchange, come to the Thing given to him in the Exchange, by the same means and manner of Assurance: For if the Lessee for Life of one Acre, give another Acre to his Lessor in Tail in Exchange, for a Release from him of that Acre, to have and to hold in Tail in like manner; this is a good Exchange. <hi>Perk.</hi> Sect. 229, 263, 267.</p>

                  <p>For it is of that Nature and Efficacy,<note place="margin">The Efficacy thereof.</note> (by reason also of the Livery of Seisin, which is evermore incident to it,) that it cleareth all Disseisins, Abatements, Intrusions, and other wrongful and defeazible Titles, and reduceth the Estate clearly to the Feoffee, when the Entry of the Feoffor is lawful: Which neither Fine, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, nor Bargain and Sale by Deed Indented and Inrolled will do, when the Feoffor is out of possession.</p>
                  <p>And it passeth the present Estate of the Feoffor,<note place="margin">Barreth present and future Right.</note> and also barreth and excludeth him of all present and future Right to the thing which is so conveyed; insomuch that if one have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Estates, all of them pass by his Feoffment, and if he have any Interest, Rent, Common,<note place="margin">Extinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> or the like, into or out of the Land, it is extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guished and gone by the Feoffment.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>This is a Deed whereby a Yearly payment of a Sum of Money, or other thing,<note place="margin">Strictly taken.</note> is granted to another in Fee, for life or years, charging the person of the Grantor only.</p>
                  <p>And this is said to differ from a Rent in many things; for that a Rent, be it Rent-service, Rent-charge, or Rent-seck, is going out of Land; but that an Annuity goeth not out of any Land, but chargeth only the Person, <hi>viz.</hi> the Grantor or his Heirs that have Assets by discent. <hi>Doct. &amp; Stud. Dial.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>Also it is said, for an Annuity no distress can be taken, nor is it ever taken for Assets, because it is no Freehold in Law, nor shall be put in
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:49986:12"/> Execution upon a Statute-Merchant, Staple, or <hi>Elegit,</hi> as a Rent may. <hi>Dyer</hi> 65, 344, 345. <hi>Co. Litt.</hi> 244.</p>
                  <p>Yet an <hi>Annuity</hi> is grantable at first; and some hold 'tis grantable over, some not. <hi>Mo. Case</hi> 18. says, it is grantable over, and yet it is but a kind of <hi>Chose en Action.</hi> Yet see <hi>Perk.</hi> Sect. 87, 101.</p>
                  <p>Also its said, an Annuity <hi>pro Consilio impenso</hi> is grantable over. <hi>Mo. case</hi> 18.</p>
                  <p>But an Annuity <hi>pro Consilio impendendo,</hi> or <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posterum impendendo,</hi> is not grantable over after the first Grant, unless it be granted to him and his Assigns. <hi>Perk.</hi> Tit. <hi>Grants.</hi> 3 <hi>Leon. case</hi> 136. <hi>Dy.</hi> 2. <hi>Co. Lit.</hi> 144. <hi>Hetley</hi> 80. <hi>Fitz. Grant</hi> 145. <hi>Bro. Grants</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>It is said, a Grant of an <hi>Annuity</hi> for Term of years, is good; but the Grantee may not have an Action of Debt for the Arrearages during the Term. 1 <hi>Cro. pag.</hi> 3.</p>
                  <p>It is said, If one grants an <hi>Annuity</hi> to him and his Heirs, to be paid yearly at two usual Feasts for 30 years, to begin after the death of the Grantor; This is a good Grant, and will charge the Heir, although at first it commence upon him; for it is for him and his Heirs. <hi>Hetley</hi> 137, 138.</p>
                  <q>But though this distinction is strictly of an Annuity to charge only the Person, and of a Rent to charge the Land; yet all Grants of Salaries or Rents are generally called <hi>Annuities,</hi> and comprehended under that Head in particular, and under a <hi>Grant</hi> in general.</q>

                  </head>
                  <p>Of <hi>Assignment</hi> it may be said further:</p>
                  <p>That he shall be intended an Assignee that hath the whole Estate of the Assignor that is assignable. Yet there is said to be an Assignee in Deed, and Assignee in Law.</p>
                  <p>Assignee in Deed, is such an one to whom a Lease, Estate or Interest is assigned.</p>
                  <p>Assignee in Law, is he whom the Law so maketh, as an Executor is an Assignee in Law; but if there be an Assignee in Deed, an Assignee in Law will not be allowed.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Assignments</hi> it is necessary to have Covenants of the Assignors part; 1. To save harmless of former Rents, Grants and Charges. 2. To deliver up former Deeds. (3) That he is Owner in possession, and hath power to grant and assign, &amp;c. 4. That the Assignee may quietly enjoy. 5. To make further Assurance.</p>
                  <p>And let the Assignee covenant to pay the Rents, and perform Covenants.</p>
                  <p>Note, That if the Lessee for years assign over his Term and dye, his Executors shall not be charged for Rent due after his death.</p>
                  <p>And if the Executors or Administrators of a Lessee for years assign over their Interest, an Action of Debt doth not lye against them for Rent; yet it seemeth, that the Lessor must have Notice of the Assignment, and consent to it. 3 <hi>Co. Walker's Case.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If a Lessee for years assign over his Term, the Lessor may charge which of them he will; but if he accept the Rent from the Assignee, (know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Assignment) he hath determined his Election, and cannot afterward bring an Action of Debt against the Lessee for Rent due after
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:49986:13"/> the <hi>Assignment,</hi> because there is no privity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; but he is left to his remedy against the Assignee. <hi>Co.</hi> 3 <hi>Rep. fo.</hi> 24. <hi>Bulstr.</hi> 2 <hi>par.</hi> 151. <hi>Poph. Rep.</hi> 55.</p>
                  <p>But yet he may bring his Action of <hi>Covenant</hi> against the Assignor, his Executors or Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strators; against the first on his express Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant or Covenant in Law; against the last it only lies on the Assignors express Covenant.</p>
                  <p>An Assignee of Lands, if he be not named in the Condition, yet he may pay the Mony to save his Land.</p>
                  <p>But he shall receive none, if he be not named, and the Tender shall be to the Executors of the Feoffees.</p>

                  <head>3. <hi>Award.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>An <hi>Award,</hi> is a Determination or Judgment, made or given between persons in Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie, by the Arbitrators or Umpire, who are such person or persons as are thereunto elected by the parties Controverting, for putting an end to Differences in Controversies between them, according to the submission of the said parties, and agreeable to Reason and good Conscience.</p>
                  <p>This Submission is best and most usual by Writing, each party entring into a Bond with Condition to the other, to stand to the Award of the Arbitrators.</p>
                  <q>And the Rule is, That such persons only may of themselves submit, as may of themselves make good Grants. <hi>West. Symb. par.</hi> 2 <hi>sect.</hi> 20.</q>
                  <p>The Husband may submit for himself and his Wife, for the Goods and Chattels of which he had disposition in right, and by reason of his Wife, and it shall bind her.</p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:49986:13"/>
                  <p>And where divers of the one part submit themselves, and divers of the other part, the Arbitrators may make an <hi>Award</hi> for Matters between them joyntly; and so for Matters be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them severally.</p>
                  <p>And where divers on each part have submit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, if the <hi>Award</hi> be betwixt some of the one party and some of the other, and take no notice of the others; such <hi>Award</hi> is said to be good. <hi>Keb.</hi> 886.</p>
                  <q>But this seems only to be where the Submission is for the whole Matters, or any parcel thereof.</q>
                  <p>For where the Submission is Conditional and with an <hi>Ita quod, &amp;c.</hi> so that the Arbitrators award all Differences, they may not make their <hi>Award</hi> of parcel, if they had notice of more. 1 <hi>Sand. Rep.</hi> 32.</p>
                  <p>And if the Submission be Conditional with a <hi>(So that, &amp;c.)</hi> and if the Arbitrators make no mention in the <hi>Award</hi> of part of the Differences of which he had Notice; yet if they award General Releases on both sides, the <hi>Award</hi> is good. <hi>Idem</hi> 33.</p>
                  <p>But an <hi>Award,</hi> where all is to be performed on the one part, and nothing on the other, is void. <hi>Idem</hi> 326, 327. <hi>Sand.</hi> 190.</p>
                  <p>In the form of every <hi>Award</hi> or <hi>Arbitrement,</hi> six things are specially to be regarded:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That it be made according to the very Submission touching the things submitted, or necessarily depending thereupon, and every other Circumstance relating thereto.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That it ought to be certain.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That it ought to be equal, and appoint either party to give or do unto the other some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beneficial, in the appearance at the least.</p>
                  <p n="4">
                     <pb n="22" facs="tcp:49986:14"/>4. That the performance thereof be lawful and possible, and within the power of the Parties.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That there be a Means, how either party may by Law attain unto that which is thereby awarded unto him.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That it be a final End of the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies submitted.</p>
                  <p>And if it fail in any of these Points, then the whole Arbitrement will be void.</p>
                  <p>Note, In the 2d <hi>Part</hi> of <hi>Sanders, Rep.</hi> 65. it is said, That an <hi>Arbitrement</hi> under the Hand and Seal of an Arbitrator, is an Especialty, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Statute of <hi>Limitations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But that a man may wage his Law against an <hi>Award</hi> under Hand and Seal, if the Submission be not by Specialty, under the Hand and Seal of the parties that submitted to the <hi>Award. Idem</hi> 65, 74. 1 <hi>Anders.</hi> 4.15.</p>
                  <p>Also if a Submission be to Arbitrators, and that if they disagree, then to an Umpire, and the <hi>Award</hi> and <hi>Umpirage</hi> are limited to the same day, there the power of the Umpire is void, unless the Arbitrators have disagreed and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, That they would not meddle further. <hi>Idem</hi> 130, 132, 133.</p>
                  <p>Again, If a Submission be to Arbitrators, so that they make their <hi>Award</hi> to Morrow, and if they cannot agree, then to an Umpire, so that he make his Umpirage to Morrow or next day; in this case the Umpire cannot make his <hi>Umpirage</hi> on the Morrow. 2 <hi>Sand.</hi> 130, 131.</p>
                  <p>And where the express Agreement of the parties shall make an <hi>Umpirage</hi> good, although the same time is limited for the Arbitrators and the Umpire to make the <hi>Award</hi> or <hi>Umpirage.</hi> See 2 <hi>Sand.</hi> 132.</p>
                  <pb n="23" facs="tcp:49986:14"/>
                  <p>Where Arbitrators, within the time limited to make their <hi>Award,</hi> may choose an Umpire to make an <hi>Umpirage</hi> after the determination of the time limited for their Award. <hi>Idem</hi> 133.</p>
                  <p>If all Debts, Sums of Mony and Demands are submitted to <hi>Arbitrement,</hi> the Arbitrators have power to award a Release of all Bonds, Speci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alties, Judgments, Executions and Extents, by which the said Debts, Sums of Mony and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands are due. <hi>Idem</hi> 190.</p>
                  <p>Where a Release is awarded of all Bonds and Judgments, whereas Bonds and Judgments were not within the Submission; yet the Defendant shall not avoid the <hi>Arbitrement,</hi> unless he shew specially, that there were some Bonds and Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments between the parties. <hi>Ibid.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>An Award, <hi>That</hi> A. <hi>should be satisfied by</hi> B. <hi>the Mony due to him for Work, and that then</hi> A. <hi>should pay</hi> 25 l. <hi>to</hi> B. <hi>and that each party should give to the other a General Release,</hi> is void in the whole, for the uncertainty of what Sum was due for Work. <hi>Idem</hi> 292, 293.</p>
                  <p>Where an <hi>Arbitrement</hi> being void in one part, shall be good for the residue, and where void for the whole; See 2 <hi>Sand.</hi> 293.</p>
                  <p>If an <hi>Award</hi> be made between <hi>A.</hi> of the one part and <hi>B.</hi> of the other, by which 'tis awarded, <hi>That</hi> A. <hi>shall pay</hi> 10 l. <hi>to</hi> B. <hi>and</hi> 5 l. <hi>to a Stranger, and that</hi> B. <hi>shall give</hi> A. <hi>a General Release;</hi> the <hi>Award</hi> as to the 5 <hi>l.</hi> is void, but good for the residue. <hi>Idem</hi> 293.</p>
                  <p>An Award, <hi>That one of the Parties shall be bound in an Obligation to the other,</hi> is good enough; but not, <hi>That he shall find Surety to enter into a Bond.</hi> Id. 337.</p>
                  <p>And Note, That upon a Promise to perform an Award, <hi>That the Defendant shall pay several Sums of Mony at several times;</hi> an Action lies for the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:49986:15"/> first Sum, and new Actions for the other Sums, as often as they shall become due. <hi>Sanders</hi> 337.</p>

                  <p>It is also used as the abstract of Joynt-tenants; and also used for joyning of one Bargain to another touching the self-same thing: And therefore <hi>Joynture</hi> in the first signification may be so called, in respect that it is a Bargain of Livelyhood for the Wife, adjoyned to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of Marriage.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Lease Parol.</note> it is not to the purpose to speak here, only to observe, That by the Statute of 29 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. for prevention of <hi>Frauds</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries.</hi> Such <hi>Leases Parol</hi> are void, if they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed three Years from the making; and if they do not exceed, yet two Third parts of the improved Value of the thing demised must be reserved to the Landlord.</p>

                     <p n="1">1. He that doth make the <hi>Release,</hi> must have such an Estate in himself, as out of which such an Estate may be derived and granted to the Relessee, as intended by the <hi>Release. Dyer</hi> 251.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. He to whom the <hi>Release</hi> is made, must have some Estate in Possession, in Deed, or in Law, or in Reversion in Deed, in his own or anothers Right of the Lands whereof the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease</hi> is made, to be as a Foundation for the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lease</hi> to stand upon: For a <hi>Release</hi> which must enure to enlarge an Estate, cannot work with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a Possession joyn'd with an Estate. <hi>Co. Lit.</hi> 265, 270, 273.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. As in all <hi>Releases</hi> that enure by way of Increase or Passing an Estate, there must be some Estate in the Relessor and the Relessee; so there must be some Privity in Estate between them at the time of the <hi>Release</hi> made: For an Estate without Privity is not sufficient. <hi>Co. Lit.</hi> 296. <hi>Lit. sect.</hi> 461.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. The fourth thing that is required in such a <hi>Release,</hi> are sufficient Words<note place="margin">Words.</note> in Law, not only to make a <hi>Release,</hi> (which is required in all Releases;) but also to create and raise a New Estate. <hi>Co.

                     <p>Note therefore, That all <hi>Releases</hi> (of what kind soever) are commonly made by these Words, <hi>Remisisse, Relaxasse, &amp; Quietum clamasse,</hi> as being the most ancient and significant Words to this purpose: And amongst these the word <hi>[Release]</hi> is the most effectual word, as that which doth include the other two, and as that which is the proper and peculiar word for this kind of Conveyance.</p>
                     <p>But there are other Words also by which a <hi>Release</hi> may be made, as <hi>Renunciare, Acquietare, &amp;c.</hi> And therefore it is held, That if one have Common in anothers Land, and he by Deed release it to him thus: <hi>Renuntio communiam me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, &amp;c.</hi> this is a good Release. <hi>Co. Lit.</hi> 264. <hi>Dyer</hi> 307.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>Release</hi> that doth enure by way of Passing away of an Estate, or Extinguishment,<note place="margin">Release upon Condition, &amp;c.</note> may be made upon Condition, or with a Defeazance, so as the Condition or Defeazance be contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Release,</hi> or delivered at the same time with it: For no Defeazance made after, can avoid the force of a <hi>Release</hi> made before. And yet a Release may be delivered as an <hi>Escrow,</hi> and so the force of it may be suspended for a time.</p>
                     <p>But a <hi>Release</hi> of a Condition, may not be made upon a Condition: Nor may a <hi>Release</hi> upon a Chattel be upon a Condition subsequent, but it may be upon a Condition precedent. And therefore if a man release a Debt to another, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Condition, That the Re-lessor may have such a Debt owing from a Third person to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessee; this is a good Condition. <hi>Co.

                     <p>A <hi>Release</hi> of all Actions may be made until a Time past; as until the 1st of <hi>March</hi> last, or until the day of the date of the <hi>Release;</hi> and this will discharge all Actions till then, and none after.</p>
                     <p>But a <hi>Release</hi> cannot be made of a Right or Action for a part of an Estate, or for a Time only; as for one Year, or until <hi>Christmas</hi> next, or the like: For a <hi>Release</hi> of such a thing for one Day, or for one Hour, is a Release for ever. And yet a Man may release his Right in part of the Land: And therefore if a man be disseised of two Acres, he may Release his Right in one of them, and enter into the other Acre.</p>
                     <p>Also a <hi>Release</hi> in the Nature of an Acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, may be of part of a Debt: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if one be bound in an Obligation of Four hundred Pounds, to pay Two hundred Pounds at <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> and at <hi>Christmas</hi> after the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gee by his Deed releaseth Three hundred Pounds, parcel of the said Four hundred Pounds; this is a good <hi>Release</hi> for so much and no more.</p>

                     <p n="2">2. That the Surrendror have an Estate in possession of the thing surrendred at the time of the Surrender made, and not a bare right there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of only.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That the Surrender be to him that hath the next immediate Estate in Remainder or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version; and that there be no Intervenient Estate coming between.</p>

                     <p n="5">5. That the Surrendree have a higher and greater Estate in the thing Surrendred, than the Surrendror hath; so that the Estate of the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendror may be drowned therein.</p>

                  <p>As to the Book it self, none who hath the least Knowledge in <hi>Conveyancing</hi> can deny the Usefulness of it at this Time, when <hi>Conveyancing</hi> is so much improved and carried so far, that it is become almost another thing, than what it was in former Times, and arrived to such a height and great perfection, That the Books of Presidents of <hi>Conveyancing</hi> formerly Printed and used, are not any ways suitable to the present Age or the Way of Conveyancing now altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Esteem; (Except the Book of <hi>Conveyances</hi> that goes under my Lord <hi>Bridgman</hi>'s Name) and therefore being such a Deficiency, it was thought Advisable to Print this Collection of Presidents, (being first approved of by a late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend Judge) which was gathered together by an Ingenious and Careful Hand, with no small Trouble and Charge, and which (without Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity) may be said to be the Best and most Perfect Book of this kind now Extant, and which is therefore heartily Recommended to the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Professors of the Common Law, who are only desired to suspend their Praises or Censures, till such time as they have Perused and Read over the same, and then entirely submit it to their great Judgments; who, I am confident, will find no cause to blame what is here Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lished to the World.</p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>Presidents</hi> themselves here Collected together; most of them, if not all, I do assure you, were Drawn or Perused by most of the greatest Hands or Judgments of this present Age, the greatest part of whom are now Living, and that upon great and emergent Occasions; some to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the Name of Great Families, and that the Estate might go along with and support the Honor; others to provide for younger Children, and to prevent Extravagant Persons from making away
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:49986:29"/> their Estate from their Posterity; many of them Marriage Settlements, with extraordinary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>visions and Limitations: All of them in General, upon your Perusal, you will find of great weight, and very useful and fit for most Occasions that may happen, and such as may be relyed on with great Safety.</p>
                  <p>I shall not longer detain the Courteous Reader from the Book it self, having already (I fear) too far trespassed on your Patience: All I shall request from you is, To Read over the Presidents herein contained with Care, and a thorough Consideration of each of them, and I then dare say, You will have the same Esteem of them that I have, who truly (for my own part) must and will own, That since I first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Master of the Book it self, I have found my self not a little Improved in things of this Nature; and by Experience, That there is great Pleasure as well as Profit in them, in making an extream Easiness both in Understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Drawing any thing of the like kind; and which gave the first Conception of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing Them to the World: And that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore You may receive the same Benefit by them, or something of the like Nature which the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisher hath had, the Whole is once again ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly Recommended by him to Your serious Perusal.</p>
